# Gesture-Recognition-Project
This project focuses on building a deep learning model to recognize and classify human gestures from video or image input. It leverages convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and other advanced machine learning techniques to achieve high accuracy in gesture recognition.

Features:

Recognizes and classifies various human gestures
Utilizes convolutional neural networks for image processing
High accuracy and real-time performance
Dataset preprocessing and augmentation for improved model training
Interactive demo showcasing gesture recognition capabilities
Technologies:

Python, TensorFlow, Keras
OpenCV for video and image processing
NumPy, Pandas for data handling
Matplotlib, Seaborn for visualization
Jupyter Notebook for experimentation and documentation

Usage:

Capture or upload a video/image containing gestures.
The model processes the input and classifies the gestures in real-time.
